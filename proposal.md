# Predicting water quality

The selected idea to be expanded into a full proposal uses the UK open water
quality archive data. The basic proposal is to predict poor water quality
in advance. This could be of use to many users of our natural water resources,
but the key stakeholder in mind for this project would be the UK
environment agency (EA). The EA could take timely pre-emptive measures to maintain
water quality before loss of wildlife occurred if given sufficient advance notice.
Possible available actions include increased monitoring at high risk times,
preparing logistics to counter adverse events (e.g. air pumps to oxygenate the
water), or changing staffing patterns.

Some suitable data have already been identified as available for immediate download 
[here](http://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/download#).
Initially we shall identify a pilot study area/year that can be expanded in
due course. It is hoped that this will provide sufficient scope. Further expansion
of data sources could include local weather data; preceding rainfall and hours of sun 
are likely useful predictors. This requires identification of a suitable data source.

The initial approach will be to investigate the predictive utility of the open
water quality archive data before widening the scope of the input data if required.
For prediction and/or inference of a continuous variable (i.e. dissolved oxygen),
linear regression is an obvious sound initial technique.

The project output will include all associated code, report and slide deck.
