# Springboard capstone project

## Introduction

This repository is intended to provide a worked example of the
stages in a Springboard data science capstone project.
The key stages, or milestones, with links to their sections in the Springboard curriculum, are:

* [initial ideas](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/596)
    [(submission)](initial_ideas.md)
* [proposal](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/576)
    [(submission)](full_proposal.md)
* [data wrangling](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/577)
    [(submission)](data_wrangling_report.md)
* [statistics](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/1169)
* [data story](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/458)
* [machine learning](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/1207)
* [final report](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/378)

So you should start from some initial ideas, write one up into a proposal, then perform some
data wrangling on your data followed by some statistical summaries. By this point you should
be able to put together an early draft of your final report as you'll be able to write about
the problem (who it's for and why), what you had to do to your data to get it "fit for purpose",
and include some preliminary exploration. What data story can you tell at this point?
Now you can dive more in-depth into your data. You should now have an idea of what your key
question, or task, is, whether it's a supervised or unsupervised problem, what features would
be good to use, and how you might assess the results. Finally you'll pull everything together
into a final product that really addresses your client's requirements in a clear way and
leaves them knowing what they're now going to do, that they couldn't before, and how.

## Repository structure

We will use git branches for each of the above stages that allows you to view what your
own repository might look like at each stage.
